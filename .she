.she


if she were a tree
	would the wind stroll by
	with cautious influence

	a smile shatter intent

or distort the cause

would the piercing edge (of?) sunset
condemn each moment

(would?) the straw grasp onto it's self by sight only
slowly eclipsed by it's own weight
darkness feeding the dark

we slowly travel by
by means of wind or sound
each case, compulsory tactic
on|a weighted stance

defuse a blade of grass
graceful stare
	assuming command over no control

all is quiet now
not calm
there's a storm outside you see


--
red brick face
slipping beneath the lawn
usurping glares

a shadow she passes
an after Sundown Grey

---
the sidewalk expressed a battlefield
(the morning after ...
wept)

we see it passing
furious flags and trees
too large an army
to feed
