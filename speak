I can't speak
the works don't fit
the configuration for sentence is wrong

dancing
dancing behind a looming dam
rapidly filling
the pressure builds

lobbing words to those below
few but heavy
from great heights
over the brim

until I regain my catfish form
to sink below
comfortable in the dark weights, depths

where. where? 
where I wish I could go
to see silence from the mad thousands of busy minds
