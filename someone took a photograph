I spoke
I got a tattoo
I took pictures
I became the focus
	of pictures by the right people
	at the right time(s)
I loved

I planned my path to destinations
			noteworthy
			quote-worthy
			gardens
			beautiful things
			dreams
I drank

I sweated
I panted
I desired
	and was

I hid
I tried to become
	something
	someone

I listened
I dressed
	to far flung destinations, I pressed
I captured the essence of dense
	compressed
	conversations
	no everything
	yes everything

I found the light
	captured
	tortured
	exposed
	and fled

I walked

I consumed
	and am, by the dense
	compressed
	conversations
	in my head
	everything

I stood
Did you see? Me?
Did you pause?
	Marvel?
	Wonder?
	Come alive?
	Did you want the same?
	Do you?
Is there anyone else out there who feels this way?
