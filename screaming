screaming against his own failure
into the night
alone

spinning songs through the ether

announcing his tornado

failure
low

what's the loss of his only fortune
denying industry
denying skyscrapers

rat cage mysticisms
throwing up personalities

counting distances of gravel
pounding careless


it's so beautiful
that sucks me
tearing me down
toilet drain brain

I've had that dream where you fall
they say when you land
you die
but I overcame that eventuality
so now what?

in the face of nothing
where is there left to go?


it's a case for street racing lungs
to failure
collision into the wall a 200+ mi/h

the rats escape it all
