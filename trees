trees

i wish i were a bonsai
Yose-ue
in the mist
walking away

pining for what's lost
since fog curtains

regally observing the air

twisted and bent
the wind haven beaten me

set in each moment
wanting
long ago
each second
eternity staring away

a mystery
waiting to see the surface

ensnared in that mysterious divide
surface and air


i                               wish 
 i were                      a bonsai
Yose-ue in                 the mist
  walking                    away

  pining for                    what's lost
  since fog                 curtains

 regally                     observing the air

   twisted                  and bent
    the wind        haven beaten me

        set in    each moment
            wanting
        long ago
        each                            second
       eternity                 staring away

         a             mystery
 waiting to see      the surface

   ensnared in that 
     mysterious divide
     surface
      and
       air
	    .
