happily
the transcendental tangential connection
to others found
or met
on/from/after a long trip home

bleary eyed
walking still more
the legs/journey
destination unmet
magnifying distance of eyes vs sleep

drain fueled palpitations
"Somehow, I'm still here"
and feet
and ground
and teeth
and air
guts turned out
apart of burnt clod

"Lift me" up/out/away
under night(lights)
disintegrating decibels fade into shadows
and my scalp
xenomorphically becoming one with one another
uneffacedly drowned into (n)one
