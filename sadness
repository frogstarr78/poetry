in the shower:
examining the distance to the wall

waiting for the sadness to wash down the drain

solid hallow shell
feeling the scalding water
unwarmed
unmoved
a boulder in the river
(I'd like to think)

I used to have such a good relationship with You
now that chasm
a sickening abysmal ache
did I just walk off?
notice some deer trail with blood on it?

getting out:
what do people think of me
mad meth man
escaping his insanity to talk to them
(the towel didn't smell like old cat piss for once)
I barely noticed

now there's this constant
indescribable fury
wanders about in clothing
