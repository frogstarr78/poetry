we're mourners
all of us mourners
			(just look around)

singing neo-poetical frost-biten tunes
   downing magnetic poles

looking after long ago landscapes
	plateaus for our soul

simpler times
that prize
in his/her arms
in their eyes
that spotlight beaming through our storm

spots where we
and the road
met for a common goal

drank tea or coffee or beer
discussing other wanders
	and their wandering

chums of olden times
like we'd never part again
never see the need
never feel it leave

...

it
would
