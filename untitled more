I wake. You look inside me.
Throughout the day,
  I may peruse your voice (admission embarrasingly or exageratingly critical).
Moments may find you calm.
Moments may recall your song.
The more I see that tangled thread
The more bound I see that said.
Announce my hope surrounded only over amazing dreams.
Streams that flow with sounds of wonder
Broiling, but calm
That sound that only action soothes,
           that only hearing tunes
me, to your view

The day with external furies raging
again and again
intent on finding my spirit and turning it to vinegar and gall
Again and again.
(Such marksmanship against such a large target. What's left? When will it break?)

The more I find
       you bind
me, not blind.
No never!

Welcome your constant voice
                      reminders
                      counsel
                      Love
