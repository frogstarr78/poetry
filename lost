i'd escape off into cemetery dreams

long ago things

so many lives ago

movies removed
strings and lines undone

each new second a distance passes
		                   escapes
						   into oblivion

where were we yesterday
used to keep it so close
is it growth

since loosing obsessive histories

when you look back what do you see?

your dreams?
pain?
longing?
