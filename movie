movie

watched a sad love song
like she was gone
she danced though a memory
someone else's love
someone else's life
no cause for alarm
the plot is almost thicker
near the end
swim
swim
i
  can't
       see 
	       myself
		         here
			        any longer

was I ever?
in someone else's love
in someone else's life

we used to have something special
now the lot is ours too

or was it always just imaginary
a dream I didn't know to wake up from
and this chamber the reality

the puddle thick as love
in someone else's love
in someone else's life

ask
the dirt'll know the answer
no end
no escape
if hurts to feel
in someone else's love
in someone else's life
