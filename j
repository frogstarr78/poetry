I feel the words behind your intent.
Such load, can I carry?
Is this wisdom?
Imagination?
Or just fury?
You're suggesting math,
but love
is philosophy.
Passion = Fury.
Don't enact your fear on me.
Because our windows are see through.
It would seem, I see you, through closed doors
and the boudoir is screaming.
