the moonlight shines
  in through so many obsticles
  the slit i nthe curtains
  onto my heart
    melting over layers of rib cages
  into jello'y cassarole stomach

  dizzy head fear, anxious to crack
    pillow scrambled
  preparing to scream through my eyes
    a stick man
    bones
    sheets blowing
    against unending winds
      never to win

mediocre balistic furry
    balking at noone 
  uneffectively
