bent
a sponge
soaking in old ash and putrid mold and sweat
  brain dancing
  in a facade of joy
hanging on
	drenched
		sharper edges around the conscious
	dragging knuckles on the heal
it panders to the pounding
	headache on the horizon
eyes sear, behind sight
the mind smears
	like butter on cement
