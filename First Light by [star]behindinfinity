you touched me
i'd been waiting
    (all night)

shocked
out of breath
weeping

i strain to show it back;
to reflect,
    in my shadowy cove,
your arcs
    light
    heat

(do you notice my intent)

i want to wake
to the lens of your shine
the uneven spline
the feedback in focus loss
    to warm
    to rise
    to breath

        escaping in that exhale
        the gas that's made

i think i see the horizon
    raising.
