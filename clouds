clouds

watching decades pass(ed)|past clouds
as fast as they move
you'd think we'd be further along by now

each thick and thin
	(passing)
darkless clear
	(through)
Chihulian space


these clouds go by


the wind brazenly bullies the tree
	an she flirts back
while the clouds have nothing to say
	just transportation


they've gone to a secluded place
  now the (only) thin croud(s) remain(s)
	where they discuss
	the wicked sun
or rest
