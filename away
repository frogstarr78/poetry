away

from the moment we met
	I knew you were different
	I'm sure that's just the nolstalgia talking

I could see your energy
	and wanted to be a part of it

I feel like a fool
	a dull cube
	like I've done nothing but hold you back

now you're away
	and I realize that part of it may have been to see
	how it's like without me in your head constantly

and I feel like we aren't together
	like you're a part of a previous life
	that might just be the feeling of the movie talking


-------------------------------------------------------
if you were a flower
	the sun would shine less bright
	it would hide behind your light

you're color would wash the rain
	in shame
	green pale plight

a fire
	igniting life

far away, you
	left a vacuum
	exhaling eternally
	ingesting the universe, me
		spaces farther than can reach you
