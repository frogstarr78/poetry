insolent grins in bins of fists

words are a semi and I the deer on the highway

words, nude nuclear fuse
have more damage in the pinhead of my poem
then your factories of numb
don't worry this munitions made for one
and I'm well fed
words are trucks of my misery
designs in fender glare
designs found in cumulus veins
obscure by distant banes 
ingest 
again
in lonesome silhouette
deciduous cast on work, porches of conversation
tablet to address the dress less desk
address the destined destitute
