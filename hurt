you hurt for your friends
with them
you take some heat from other people
    on account of them, for them, in-spite of them
knowing their value
accepting the cost

with a note
    in her time of hurt
you turned around
    can't suffer for you
and left for dead
    don't know the outcome, or care
    
you just know you won't hurt
