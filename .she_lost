she spoke in a room
he didn't listen

the silence awoke them
spread out like a blanket on the bed
shared and warm
but so far away

each isolary pod
it's own dark cloud in the atmosphere
against the surface of gray
unseen,
unmoving, 
unaware of one another

once a sun (aglow)
sparks shorn 
as birth
in unknown discovery shared
aware of the cause
sure the effect

the days unmet time
exhausting waves
	wind
	light


time a toy
	each moment a life spent
	away
	away

isn't it ironic the next day it'll
	ask it back
	(time)
